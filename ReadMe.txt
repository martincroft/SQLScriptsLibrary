This repository is a set of scripts that was presented at SQL bits 2022. The repository was original private but has been made public. 
I will be maintaining a private and this public version as I evolve my own script library.
You can access the scripts through .\home.ipynb and the hyper links will take you to the other notebooks. You will need to trust the notebooks
for the hyper links to work.

The SSMS solution can be found at C:\SQLScriptsLibrary\SSMS\SQLScriptLibrary\SQLScriptLibrary.ssmssln

It is advised you pull save the repository to C:\SQLScriptsLibrary. There are currently had coded links which I will update so in future version should be able to put in folder of choice.
This is a work in progress, and I will look to have weekly updates (porting my existing scripts to the Azure notebooks format and also added into the SSMS solution)
Any suggestions, recommendations, corrections, accreditations ( I try and link back to original source if known), questions please feel free to  contact me on Twitter (MartinCroft) or Email (Martin.Croft@SQLServersolutions.co.uk)


Thanks

Martin
